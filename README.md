# Predicting-Next-Day-Rain-in-Australia

This project aims to predict whether it will rain in Australia the next day by leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), based on a dataset containing about 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia.

Overview

The dataset used in this project contains detailed weather observations collected over a span of 10 years from multiple locations across Australia. The target variable to be predicted is 'RainTomorrow', which signifies whether it rained the next day. This column is labeled as 'Yes' if the rainfall for that day measured 1mm or more.

Data Source

The weather data was sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and Bureau of Meteorology's climate data repository. Please note that the dataset is the copyright of the Commonwealth of Australia 2010, Bureau of Meteorology.

Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model using Artificial Neural Networks to predict whether it will rain in Australia the next day based on the historical weather observations available in the dataset.
